    question: "Tell me about a time you followed safety procedures to the letter.",
    why: "To assess if you respect rules and can be trusted in a safety-critical environment.",
    example: {
      S: "In my current job, I work in a busy retail store that requires strict health and safety procedures.",
      T: "One of my tasks involves unloading and storing heavy deliveries in the stockroom.",
      A: "I always ensure I wear the correct PPE, follow the correct lifting techniques, and keep walkways clear to avoid trip hazards. Even when we‚Äôre busy, I take the time to double-check that everything is safe and nothing is blocking fire exits.",
      R: "Because of this, our manager regularly uses me as an example when training new staff on safe working practices."
    }
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "How do you stay focused during long, repetitive tasks?",
    why: "Train drivers work solo and need to stay alert over long periods.",
    example: {
      S: "On some shifts, I‚Äôm on the tills for several hours at a time with limited breaks.",
      T: "It‚Äôs important to stay alert to avoid errors like scanning items twice or giving incorrect change.",
      A: "I keep myself focused by setting small mental goals, such as keeping each transaction smooth and friendly, and doing quick mental checks after each customer. I also stay hydrated and take my breaks properly to reset.",
      R: "As a result, I rarely make mistakes and have received praise from supervisors for being consistent throughout long shifts."
    }
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "What would you do if a colleague wasn‚Äôt following safety procedures?",
    why: "They want to know you‚Äôll act professionally and won‚Äôt ignore safety breaches.",
    example: {
      S: "At work, I noticed a colleague stacking boxes in front of a fire exit.",
      T: "I knew this was against safety rules and could be dangerous in an emergency.",
      A: "I reminded them politely that the fire exit needed to stay clear, and I helped move the boxes. Then I mentioned it to the supervisor, just to make sure it wouldn‚Äôt happen again.",
      R: "My manager thanked me for taking initiative, and it helped reinforce the rule with the rest of the team."
    }
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Why do you want to be a train driver?",
    why: "They want genuine motivation‚Äînot just ‚ÄúI like trains‚Äù.",
    example: {
      R: "I‚Äôve always been drawn to structured, responsible work, and I‚Äôm ready for a new long-term challenge. I enjoy working independently and being trusted to do things properly. I‚Äôm well-suited to a job where safety, punctuality, and consistency matter. I‚Äôve looked into the shift patterns and the training, and I‚Äôm prepared to fully commit. Being a train driver offers a career with progression and purpose‚Äîand I want to be part of something that keeps the country moving."
    }
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "What do you understand about the safety-critical nature of the role?",
    why: "They want to know if you truly grasp the seriousness of being a driver.",
    example: {
      R: "As a train driver, every decision you make affects hundreds of people‚Äôs lives, including your own. You have to be alert, focused, and never take shortcuts. That means following all rules and procedures, staying calm under pressure, and knowing when to act and when to escalate issues. I understand this isn‚Äôt a job where you can ‚Äúguess‚Äù or switch off‚Äîit‚Äôs about responsibility and precision every single day."
